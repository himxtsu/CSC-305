Assignment #2

For this assignment I had the idea of making a dragon circle a castle.

Textures:
There is a total of 9 textures downloaded in the file directory however I only ended up using 7 of them in the final scene. Each texture was downloaded from OpenGameArt.org!
Each texture was individually mapped to a specific object in the scene to present their purpose. 

Dragon:
I reused the legs from the first assignment however, I made flapping wings and wiggling tail for the 3 levels of hierarchy. It is also oscillating side to side simulating
a flying animal. All movements were made to work with realtime. The dragon was made up from all cubes.

Castle:
The castle was made up from a cube, cylinders, and cones. 

Trees:
I made a function for the trees for easier "drawing". The trees were made of cylinders and cones. 

The camera is spinning counter-clockwise whilst looking at the center of the scene and is operating in realtime.

I have converted the ADS shader from a vertex shader to a fragment shader by making an ads function in my main.html file. 
I also converted it from Phong to Blinn-Phong

As for the shader effect, I have decided to implement a "vignette" shader. This added a dramatic effect for my objects. It almost acts like Ambient Occlusion!. 
I liked how it turned out because it made it nicer to look at and less flat. 


Overall, this assignment was WAYYY harder than the first assignment. Fortunately, the practice from the first assignment helped me design the scene faster than what I have 
predicted. It is nice to play with textures and all the lighting effects in this assignment and just seeing all the possibilities that I could've ended up with. Altough I changed
my idea about 3 times, I am quite happy on how this turned out!
